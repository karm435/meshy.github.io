# Privacy Policy
<br>

## 1.0 Information We Collect
Meshy does not collect any personal information or data related to you. All gradient creations, settings, and user preferences are stored locally on your device.

### 1.2 Information you provide to us 
All gradient data, color configurations, templates, and export settings you create stay on your device. We do not transmit, store, or access any of your creative work or personal information.
<br>

## 2.0 What Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it
We do not collect any personal information. Meshy operates entirely offline for gradient creation and editing. Any data generated through your use of the app remains on your device.

<br>

## 3.0 How we keep and secure the Personal Information we collect
All gradient data, configurations, and settings are stored locally on your device using secure iOS storage mechanisms. If you wish to delete all data, simply delete the app from your device.

## 4.0 Export and Sharing Features
When you export gradients to your Photos app or share gradient configurations as JSON data, this is done through standard iOS sharing mechanisms. We do not have access to or store copies of your exported content.

## 5.0 Premium Features
If you choose to purchase premium features, payment is processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store payment information - this is handled entirely by Apple.

## 6.0 Data Retention
Since all data is stored locally on your device, data retention is entirely under your control. Gradient configurations and settings persist until you delete the app or manually clear them through the app's interface.

## 7.0 Your Rights
You have complete control over your gradient data. You can export configurations as JSON files for backup, delete individual gradients, or remove all data by deleting the app.

## 8.0 Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in app updates and on this page.
